## Help us grow
Lazysodium needs your support for it to continue being maintained and improved. Even if you put forward £1/$1/€1 it still means a lot to us. Funding comes from the company that owns Lazysodium, [Terl](https://terl.co). However, we want our open-source projects to live a life of their own independent of any business. That's why we ask you to become a supporter. Your money goes towards our open-source projects first and foremost. You can read more about our decisions to open a Patreon account by clicking the button below.

If Patreon's not your style then please suggest another avenue through our issue tracker.
